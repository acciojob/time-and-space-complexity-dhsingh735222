    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a computational concept that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as the input size grows. Efficient algorithms are crucial in optimizing performance, especially for large datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. It is usually expressed in terms of O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input data. Optimizing space complexity is important to ensure that the algorithm runs within acceptable memory limits.</p>
