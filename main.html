    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. Analyzing time complexity helps us determine how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.
