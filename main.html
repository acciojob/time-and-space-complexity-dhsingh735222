    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how the time to complete the task grows with the input size. Efficient algorithms are essential for handling large datasets effectively.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the size of the input data. It is generally represented by O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input. Managing space complexity is crucial to ensure the algorithm operates within acceptable memory constraints.</p>
